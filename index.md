# Azure Center of Excellence (CoE)
This Knowledge Base (**KB**) and git repo provides information, examples, ARM templates and scripts to facilitate the implementation of the Azure Data & Analytics Platform (**ADAP**) based on the guidance provided by Microsoft and the [Cloud Adoption Framework (**CAF**)](https://aka.ms/CAF). The focus of this section of the KB is specifically targeted at Data Services Engineers and Architects responsible for planning, migrating, securing, governing, managing and developing on the [Azure Data & Analytics Platform (**ADAP**)](Cloud-Adoption-Framework/Reference/Azure-Data-and-Analytics-Platform.md)

The [Azure Reference Architecture (**ADAP**)](Cloud-Adoption-Framework/Reference/Azure-Data-and-Analytics-Platform.md) is built on top of the [CAF Landing Zone](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/samples/caf-migrate-landing-zone/). The [Azure Data & Analytics Platform (**ADAP**)](Cloud-Adoption-Framework/Reference/Azure-Data-and-Analytics-Platform.md) will take a dependency on the [Core Landing Zone Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/).

This **KB** will align purposely to the [Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (**CAF**)](https://aka.ms/CAF) implementation phases. The intent is to leverage the guidance in the **CAF**, with specific and concrete implementation patterns for the Azure Data & Analytics Platform (ADAP).

The most important thing that you can do is familiarize yourself with the [Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (**CAF**)](https://aka.ms/CAF). We will leverage the CAF as a team and continue to push its boundaries. Where there are gaps we will lean on Microsoft to provide clarity. 

## Getting Started
With a strong understanding of [Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (**CAF**)](https://aka.ms/CAF), it now time to identify and define the "**fundamentals**" of how we at Quisitive will implement the prescriptive guidance in the [**CAF**](https://aka.ms/CAF).
